## ðŸ‘‹ Hello World!

I'm Ankit Pande, a passionate second-year computer science student with a keen interest in crafting digital experiences. My journey into the world of coding began with a fascination for web development, and since then, I've been on a quest to explore the realms of terminal programming and AI development.

### ðŸš€ What I'm into:

- **Web Development:** Turning ideas into interactive and user-friendly websites is my forte. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are my go-to tools for front-end magic, while I love to dive into the backend with technologies like Node.js and Express.

- **Terminal Programming:** The command line is my playground. I enjoy building efficient and powerful scripts that make life in the terminal a breeze. Shell scripting and automation are some of my favorite tools of the trade.

- **AI Development:** Exploring the fascinating world of artificial intelligence, I'm diving into machine learning and deep learning. From tinkering with neural networks to implementing AI solutions, I'm on a quest to make machines smarter.
